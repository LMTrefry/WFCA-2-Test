//What do I need to figure out?
//1. How to reference clones.
//2. How to reference array items from a different script.
//3. How to make the size of the waypoints array dependent on the amount of clones present.

//Should we use getchild like in OverlapWFC line 91?

// Numbers 1 and 2 are tied together.
